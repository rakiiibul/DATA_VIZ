![](data/image/cardata.jpg)

In our Data Visualization course, I have learnt about the Grammar of Graphics,how to use ggplot2 for data visualization,other package of R to  visualize scatter plots,basic bar charts, histograms, pie charts,violin plots, line plots,  box plots and how to further customize plots using themes.In this workshop, I try to analyse car data using those technique.By this visualization tools we can easily get a clear overview about car properties and performance with a quick view. To conclude, we can say that Data visualization is one of the useful technologies for data scientist.

Here, you'll find the car data which I have used for this workshop:
